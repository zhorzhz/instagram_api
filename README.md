Instagram simple login and requests. 
For use:  1) open modules/instagramRequests.js file and change clientId and clientSecret to your application paramteres 
          2) open index.html from local server 
          3) node run server.js P.S: Some functionalities can not work while your application is on SANDBOX mode.

Thanks for using.
With best regards Zhorzh Zakaryan
